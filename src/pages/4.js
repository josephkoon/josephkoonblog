		<p style={{color:'gray'}}>April 15, 2020</p>
		<br/>

		<p>Social distancing is getting old. Local meetup events are non-existent. How can we network? How can we find mentors?</p>
		<p>The solution : Remote Mastermind Meetings</p>
		<p>Sign up. Enter your industry, age, desires for networking. Get matched to a small group (or pick from a few) with scheduled weekly meetings over video chat</p>
		<p>Introduce yourself. Get personalized feedback on your business or career issues. Grow your network</p>
		<p>Groups could be niched / specialized. Marketing minds. Public relation minds. Sales minds....</p>
		<p>100% Confidential</p>

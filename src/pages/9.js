			<p>Business is a science of people. Understanding what they like. Understanding what motivates them. Understanding how to make the most people happy.</p>

			<p>Business truly isn’t about money. The business that succeed serves and connects the most people. It solves people’s problems (and not just customers but employees, vendors, wholesalers etc).</p>

			<p>Thing about social networks. Thing about online games. Connect people. Make things that people like.</p>

			<p>So, be a people pleaser.</p>

			<p>(On the opposite end. Businesses that fail do not thing about people. Do not think about their needs. Do not make things that they truly love. They take more than what they provide.)</p>

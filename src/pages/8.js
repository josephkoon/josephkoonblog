		<h1>Donation Economics</h1>
		<p style={{color:'gray'}}>April 26, 2020</p>
		
		<br/>
		<p>Instead of charging a flat transaction or ‘platform fee’ several web platforms have switched to donation / tipping systems.</p> 
		<br/>

		<p><strong>Examples :</strong></p>
		<p>GoFundMe no longer charges a flat ‘service fee’. Instead, at checkout the donator can select a ‘tip’. These tips start at $1 recommended.</p>
		<p>BandCamp Artists have the option of enabling ‘Name Your Price’ on their album sales. Their fans can enter a price or download it completely free.</p>

		<br/>
		<p><strong>What are the implications of this?</strong></p>
		<p>The ‘recommended’ or ‘minimum’ tips could be higher than a flat platform fee.</p>
		<p>Their revenue shifts to being based on ‘social obligation’ rather than a price.</p>
		<p>It is possible that their revenue is actually much higher with the 'name your price' model then a flat fee</p>

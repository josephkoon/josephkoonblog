		<p style={{color:'gray'}}>April 14, 2020</p>
		<br/>
		<p>This is the insanely cool 80's supercar the Vector R8.</p>
		<p>Many of its components and design elements come directly from aerospace industry</p>
		<p>It has the 80's retro-future aesthetic as if it was pulled right of of Blade Runner or as if it might become a Transformer.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>It was barely street legal and produced by a small American company that was trying to break into the 'super car' market to compete with foreign brands like Lamborghini.</p>

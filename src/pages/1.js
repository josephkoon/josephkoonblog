		<p>Wouldn't it be great to have your bike picked up or delivered?</p>
		<p>My car never fits a bike. I don't want to have to add a bike rack... and can't rent a truck just to move the bike</p>
		<p>It'd be awesome to have a on-demand service to transport bikes</p>
		<br/>
		<p>I mentioned this to my friend Joel... he thought it'd be great for other types of sports gear like Canoes</p>
		<p>I'm imaginging a special vehicle... a truck the expands to reveal the bikes within</p>
		<p>What are the use-cases? I need a bike delivered for the day. I road a bike several hundred miles and need a ride bike. I want a canoe delivered for the weekend...</p>

		<p>The vehicle could end up looking something like this. An expanding vehicle with racks for different types of gear</p>
